# Stereo-Depth-YOLOv5
This repository contains the full codebase, data structure, and calibration files developed for a research project conducted at The University of Western Australia (UWA). The system integrates YOLOv5 object detection with stereo vision to estimate weed position in 3D space using Raspberry Pi Camera Module 3 sensors and a Raspberry Pi 5.
