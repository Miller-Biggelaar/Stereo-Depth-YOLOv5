Stereo-Weed-Detection

Stereo-based Weed Detection and Depth Estimation using YOLOv5 on Raspberry Pi 5

‚∏ª

üå± Overview

This repository contains the full codebase, data structure, and calibration files developed for a research project conducted at The University of Western Australia (UWA).
The system integrates YOLOv5 object detection with stereo-based depth estimation to estimate weed positions in three-dimensional space using Raspberry Pi Camera Module 3 sensors and a Raspberry Pi 5.

The project demonstrates a low-cost, embedded vision solution for precision agriculture ‚Äî capable of identifying and localising weeds through 2D detection and stereo disparity mapping.
